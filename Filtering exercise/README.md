This is an exercise for learning how to use scipy in order ot apply filters to images, this was done on the internet on colab, but due to how it works, i decided to try and paste my work onto vs code and edit it in order for it to work within it. P.S. it will pop up the image results with the filters, and in order to continue with the program you must close the images when youre done looking at them.
